# Logistic Regression from Scratch

A step-by-step implementation of logistic regression using only NumPy â€” no machine learning libraries. This notebook is designed for learning purposes and demonstrates how logistic regression works under the hood.

## Features

* Implements binary classification using logistic regression
* Includes:

  * Sigmoid function
  * Loss (Binary Cross-Entropy)
  * Gradient Descent optimization
  * Accuracy evaluation

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* NumPy
## What You'll Learn

* Core math behind logistic regression
* How gradient descent updates model weights
* How to implement a simple classifier from scratch

## Example Output

```
Final accuracy: 95%
```

## Author

Built with learning in mind.
