# 🧠 ML Models from Scratch

**A professional-grade implementation of core Machine Learning algorithms from first principles — in pure Python and NumPy.**

This repository is a foundational engineering exercise: each model is built from scratch to demonstrate mathematical understanding, implementation skill, and production-readiness — without relying on high-level libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow.

## 📦 Algorithms to be Implemented

We will implement the following core machine learning algorithms **from scratch**, focusing on both foundational supervised and key unsupervised methods:

### Supervised Learning Algorithms

- **Linear Regression**  
- **Logistic Regression**  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
- **Decision Tree Classifier**  
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
- **Naive Bayes Classifier**  

### Unsupervised Learning Algorithms

- **K-Means Clustering**  
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
