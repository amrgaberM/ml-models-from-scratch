🧠 ML Models from Scratch
A professional-grade collection of core Machine Learning algorithms implemented from first principles using Python and NumPy.
This repository is a rigorous engineering exercise designed to showcase deep mathematical understanding, clean code, and production-ready implementations—without relying on high-level libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow. Each model is built from scratch to demonstrate both theoretical mastery and practical coding skills.

🎯 Project Objectives

✅ Master the mathematical foundations of machine learning algorithms
✅ Translate theory into modular, production-ready Python code
✅ Enhance debugging, testing, and numerical reasoning capabilities
✅ Build a portfolio that highlights algorithmic expertise and engineering discipline


📦 Algorithms to be Implemented
The following core machine learning algorithms will be implemented from scratch, covering both supervised and unsupervised methods:

Linear Regression
Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Decision Tree Classifier
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Naive Bayes Classifier
K-Means Clustering
Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Each implementation will include:

Clean, modular code with comprehensive inline documentation
Interactive Jupyter notebooks for step-by-step demos and visualizations
Unit tests (where applicable) to ensure correctness and reliability

🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ml-models-from-scratch.git


Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Explore a model:

Navigate to a model directory (e.g., 01_linear_regression/).
Open the notebook_demo.ipynb in Jupyter for an interactive walkthrough.
Run unit tests (e.g., python test_linear_regression.py) to verify functionality.




🧪 Testing & Reliability
Select models include lightweight unit tests to validate:

Correctness: Expected outputs for known inputs
Numerical stability: Convergence and shape consistency
Error handling: Robustness to edge cases

Tests are designed for manual execution and are compatible with pytest for future CI integration.
