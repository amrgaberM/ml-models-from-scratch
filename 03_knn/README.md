# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier from Scratch

This project implements a simple K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier **from scratch** using only NumPy. It demonstrates the fundamental working of the KNN algorithm and validates the implementation using the classic Iris dataset.

## Features

- Written entirely from scratch in Python
- Supports multi-class classification
- Uses Euclidean distance to find nearest neighbors
